# YAESU FRG-9600 Knob

This OpenSCAD source file is to generate a model for the knob of the
UHF/VHF radio receiver YAESU FRG-9600; in the '80s it was one of the
best receivers in his category and still today it remains a good
receiver (unfortunately there is much less to listen today than in the
'80s).

The knob model is quite similar, but not identical, to the orginal as
you can see on the following photo:
