# YAESU FRG-9600 Knob

This OpenSCAD source file generates a model of the knob for the YAESU
FRG-9600 UHF/VHF radio receiver. In the ’80s, it was one of the best
receivers in its category, and it still remains a good receiver today
(although, unfortunately, there is much less to listen to now than
there was in the ’80s).

The knob model is quite similar, but not identical, to the original,
as you can see in the following photo:
